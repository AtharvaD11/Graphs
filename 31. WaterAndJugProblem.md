### Solution : BFS

```
class Solution {
public:
    bool canMeasureWater(int jug1Capacity, int jug2Capacity, int targetCapacity) {
        int x = jug1Capacity, y = jug2Capacity;
        int z = x+y;
        
        vector<int> vis(z+1, 0);
        vector<int> steps = {x, -x, y, -y};
        queue<int> q;
        q.push(0);
        vis[0] = 1;
        while(q.size()){
            int node = q.front();
            q.pop();
            
            if(node == targetCapacity) return true;
            
            for(int i=0;i<4;i++){
                int newNode = node + steps[i];
                if(newNode >= 0 && newNode <= z && vis[newNode]==0){
                    vis[newNode] = 1;
                    q.push(newNode);
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

### Solution : Bezout's identity

This question can be solved using Bézout's identity<br>
Bézout's identity (also called Bézout's lemma) is a theorem in the elementary theory of numbers:
let a and b be nonzero integers and let d be their greatest common divisor. Then there exist integers x and y such that ax+by=d<br>
In addition, the greatest common divisor d is the smallest positive integer that can be written as ax + by every integer of the form ax + by is a multiple of the greatest common divisor d<br>

```
class Solution {
public:
    bool canMeasureWater(int x, int y, int z) {
        if(x + y == x || x == z || y == z) return true;
        if(x + y < z) return false;
        int g = __gcd(x,y);
        return (z%g == 0);
    }
};
